# XorShiftAnd
XorShiftAnd is a pseudo random number generator for generating streams.

In this study, a new random number generator named XorShiftAnd inspired by Xorshift generator is used. XorShiftAnd is a generator designed for stream encryption. The most important feature of this generator, which is designed based on the logical AND operator and the full value function, is that the key length can be controlled. So, generator differs from other studies in the literature. While this approach has the speed advantage of symmetric encryption, it is also secure due to the flexible nature of the key length. With the developed random number generator, images are encrypted using 64-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit and 2048-bit keys. Encrypted images and original images were compared using entropy, Pearson correlation coefficient and peak signal-to-noise ratio metrics. Security attack tests were carried out to test the security of the encryption process. In addition, the results obtained from LCG and logistic mapping methods were compared.
